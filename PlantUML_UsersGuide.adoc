= PlantUML User Guide: Hierarchical State Machines

Welcome to the PlantUML User Guide focused on creating hierarchical state machines. This guide is designed to help you utilize a specific subset of PlantUML syntax for state machines, enabling the generation of code from your diagrams. Note that only selected features of PlantUML for state machines are supported here.
The state machine Autocoder supports the following features: +
- Hierarchical states +
- Complex junctions +
- Complex initial transitions +
- Transition guards and actions +
- Internal transitions +
- Self transitions

The state machine Autocoder does NOT support the following features: + 
- Sub state machines +
- Orthogonal regions

In addition, the parser does not support PlantUML graphical layout information.  This may be supported on later releases.


== Defining States

=== Basic State Definition

To define a state, use the `state` keyword followed by the state's name and enclose any nested states or definitions within curly braces `{}`.

[source,plantuml]
----
state S2 {
}
----

=== Nested States

States can be nested within other states to represent hierarchical relationships.

[source,plantuml]
----
state S2 {
    state S21 {
    }
}
----

=== Entry and Exit Actions

Specify actions that occur on entering or exiting states by appending `:Entry:` or `:Exit:` to the state name, followed by the action.

[source,plantuml]
----
state S2 {
    S2:Entry: foo()
    S2:Exit: bar()
}
----

Multiple actions can be delineated using semicolons `;`.

[source,plantuml]
----
state S2 {
    S2:Entry: foo(); foo2()
    S2:Exit: bar(); bar2()
}
----

== Initial Transitions

=== Global Initial Transition

Define an initial transition for the state machine using `[*]` to indicate the start point.

[source,plantuml]
----
[*] --> S2
----

=== Hierarchical Initial Transition

Each hierarchical state must also have an initial transition.

[source,plantuml]
----
state S2 {
    [*] --> S21
    S2:Entry: foo()
    S2:Exit: bar()
    state S21 {
    }
}
----

== Regular Transitions

Transitions between states are defined using the format: `source_state --> target_state : Event [guard()] / action()`.

=== Transition with Event

[source,plantuml]
----
S2 --> S3 : Ev1
----

=== Transition with Event and Guard

[source,plantuml]
----
S2 --> S3 : Ev1[guard()]
----

=== Transition with Event and Action

[source,plantuml]
----
S2 --> S3 : /action()
----

=== Transition with Event, Guard, and Action

[source,plantuml]
----
S2 --> S3 : Ev1[guard()]/action()
----

== Junction States

Junctions, or choice points, allow for branching transitions and are defined as a state with the `<<choice>>` stereotype.

=== Defining a Junction

[source,plantuml]
----
state c1 <<choice>>
----

=== Using Junctions in Transitions

Once defined, junctions can facilitate multiple branching paths.

[source,plantuml]
----
state c1 <<choice>>
S1 --> c1 : Ev1
c1 --> S1 : [guard()]
c1 --> S2 : /action()
----

== Internal Transitions

Internal transitions handle events within the same state, without causing a state change.

=== Example of an Internal Transition

Here, `Ev2` triggers `a1()` without leading to a state transition.

[source,plantuml]
----
state S1 {
    S1:Internal: Ev2/a1()
}
----

== Comments
Any line prefixed with `'` is considered a comment line and is ignored by the parser.

This guide provides a concise yet comprehensive overview of using PlantUML to define hierarchical state machines, enabling you to effectively illustrate and generate code for your system's architecture.
